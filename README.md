# ansible-public
Mostly random odds and ends.
I'll update these things as needed, I've been in the process to transitioning to AWX from standard Ansible so this may take time as I don't plan to upload anything here that I haven't migrated.

Bad news is that this is a downstream repo, I don't update it that often or at least until everything tests well upstream for some time, Some stuff here is 2.10 compatible, some is 2.11 compatible, kinda an mixed bag.
